                   A component can be anything you see on the web. A button, an image gallery or a navigation bar. Everything is called a component. The main concept about components is that they often are programmed to be reusable. A developer can create a navigation component thats flexible and can be used on every page. Same goes for the image galler component. Maybe it wont be on every page, but only on a couple. However, its reusable, and we can insert it when we need, and where we need it to be. This form of layout and design had been incredible popular over the last years, and more and more developers are adapting to the metology of component based design.

                    The image above illustrates the idèa behind web components. Its like pieces or blocks of lego. Splitting the layout into seperate parts, each component is isolated, but together form a great and userfriendly application. By first creating isolated, extensible components, we are able to remove a lot of duplicated effort when it comes to collaboration. It also make the developer process very easy to adapt to. There’s less of a hand-off and more continual collaboration.
